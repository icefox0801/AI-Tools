## 🎬 Complete Workflow: From Audio to Insights

This is the typical workflow showing how Live Captions and Audio Notes work together.

### Step 1: Configure Live Captions

Launch Live Captions from system tray and configure your settings:

<img width="291" alt="Live Captions Tray Menu" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45f07f39-fe52-47bc-abb7-d103326087e2" />

- **Audio Source**: Choose "System Audio" (for videos/meetings) or "Microphone" (for your voice)
- **ASR Model**: Select Whisper (accurate), Parakeet (fast), or Vosk (CPU)
- **Enable Recording**: Turn on to save audio for later transcription
- **Live Transcription**: Enable to see real-time captions

### Step 2: Capture Audio

Play a video, join a meeting, or speak into your microphone:

Live Captions displays real-time transcription as audio plays:

<img width="3080" alt="Speak now - Live transcription in progress" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c3d5e5e-6827-42e1-a6c6-86f944837721" />

- Captions appear in a floating overlay window
- The window shows "Speak now..." when ready to capture
- Recording saves audio files automatically when enabled

### Step 3: Transcribe & Analyze in Audio Notes

Open Audio Notes at http://localhost:7860 to process your recordings:

<img width="2848" alt="Audio Notes with Full Transcript, Summary, and Chat" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47fbc1b1-70c2-45fd-885c-ca000714c1d7" />

1. **Select Recording** - Your saved recordings appear in the Recordings panel
2. **Choose ASR Backend** - Whisper (accurate) or Parakeet (fast)
3. **Click Transcribe** - Generates full text transcript
4. **View Tabs**:
   - **Full Transcript** - Complete searchable text
   - **Summary** - AI-generated summary of key points
   - **Chat** - Ask questions about the content

### Step 4: Chat with Your Content

Use the Chat tab to interact with your transcript:

- "What are the main topics discussed?"
- "Summarize the key action items"
- "What did the speaker say about machine learning?"
- "Create a study guide from this content"

**Result**: Audio → Real-time captions → Saved recording → Transcript → Summary → Interactive Q&A
